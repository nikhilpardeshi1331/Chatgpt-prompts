This DAG (gcs_to_bq_load_dag) is designed to load data from a file in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) into a BigQuery table. Below is a brief overview of the components and workflow of the DAG:

1. Purpose

The DAG performs the following:

Reads a configuration file from GCS.

Extracts necessary details like project_id, dataset_id, table_id, and the file_path from this configuration.
